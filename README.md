# food-service-reviews-sentiment-analysis
This project uses Machine Learning to classify feedback for a food delivery company, providing sentiment analysis and identifying influential words for improvement. I also used web scraping to collect real-world data to test the model.

Considering that I'm a lifelong lover of food, it only makes sense that my first Machine Learning project revolved around this delicious topic. I set out to create a smart system that could sort feedback for a food delivery company into three categories: good, bad, or neutral. 

I wanted to create something practical that could make a real impact on improving customer experiences in the food delivery industry.
To ensure the model's effectiveness, I gathered a diverse dataset of up to a thousand comments and labels, carefully categorizing each feedback based on its sentiment. 

But I didn't stop there. I wanted to put my model to the test with real-world data. So, I rolled up my sleeves and used web scraping techniques to collect actual reviews from an app called 'Eden'. These genuine reviews, straight from the users, served as the perfect validation for my model's performance and its ability to handle real-life scenarios.

By combining the power of Natural Language Processing and the Naive Bayes classifier, my model became a reliable feedback classifier. 

It can accurately analyze and categorize comments, enabling the food delivery company to understand customer sentiments and identify areas for improvement. This project showcases the practicality of Machine Learning in the food domain and its potential to revolutionize customer satisfaction and service quality in the fast-paced world of food delivery.
